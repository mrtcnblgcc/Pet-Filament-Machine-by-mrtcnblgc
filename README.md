# Pet-Filament-Machine-by-mrtcnblgc

## Making PET filament for 3D Printer from PET bottles.

## Part List:
#### **Electronical :**
- 200V AC to 12V DC/5A power supply. 
- Arduino Mini (5V, 16 Mhz).
- A4988 Step Motor Driver.
- SSD1306 OLED Display.
- 12V Heater.
- IRFZ44N Mosfet.
- 100k Ohm Thermistor.
- LM317T Voltage Regulator.
- Switch.
- Capacitors (2x4.7uF, 1x100nF).
- Resistors (1x100r, 1x330r, 5x10k, 1x1k, 1x4.7k).
- 2.54mm Male and Female Connectors.

#### **Mechanical :**
- 3D Printed parts. I'm using ecodecat3d's STL files for gear set. You can visit him/her site (https://sites.google.com/view/makeyourownecopet/inicio).
- 4x 608zz model ruller for gear set.
- Some dimensions screws and nuts.
- 3D Printer extruder set. (Heating block and nozzle) You need to expand the nozzle to 1.75mm.
- L shaped metal shelf holder for hold extruder.
- 3D Printed bottle cutter. I'm using this (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5442876).
- Suitable pieces of wood for the floor

## Instructions
A wooden or similar base is required where you will place the gear box and heater block. First, you need to create the gear box, connect the motor to the gear box. Then, you should place the heater block in line with the gear box. I placed the power supply behind the wooden block that I used. If you want, you can place it in an independent place. You can also place the piece that we will use to cut the pet bottles on this wooden base like I did.
